Hi there. This is my first blog post. 

I'm following a tutorial by [this dude](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) to create github pages using Jekyll and markdown.
I'm familiar with Markdown but this is my first time using Jekyll - it seems promising. 

I'm doing this during the COVID-19 lockdown of my country. 
Although the situation is supposedly easing up, I'm still trying to find ways to occupy my time. 
Thought I'd try my hand at a few new projects.

*So here goes nothing.*
